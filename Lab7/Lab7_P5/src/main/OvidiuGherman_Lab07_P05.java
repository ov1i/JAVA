 * Write a class called Calculator which has the methods to do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The
 * methods will take generic input variables and will return the corresponding type. For example, the sum of two integers
 * should return an integer, and for floats it should return a float. Same for division. Adding and subtracting is allowed for
 * String variables as well, but the multiplication and division will print an error message.
 * Write the same class, but use method overloading.
