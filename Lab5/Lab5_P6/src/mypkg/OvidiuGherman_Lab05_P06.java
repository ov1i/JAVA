 * Define an interface called ChessPiece which defines the prototype for the method move(). Create the specific classes
 * for each of the chess pieces and implement the move() method according to the rules of movement on the chess board.
 * The method takes as input the chess pieceâ€™s current location and the direction of the move given by the geographical
 * coordinates (N, S, E, V, NE, NV, SE, SV), and returns the final position of the piece. Pay attention to the pieces which can
 * move a different number of cells!!
