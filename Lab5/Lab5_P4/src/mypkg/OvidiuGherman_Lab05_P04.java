/* 4.
 * Consider the Fraction class that has two protected attributes a and b for the counter and denominator, two set () and
 * get () methods for each of the class attributes. Define an explicit constructor without parameters that initiates a with 0
 * and b with 1, and an explicit constructor with two parameters that can be called if it is checked whether a fraction can
 * be defined (b! = 0). Define a method simplify () that simplifies and returns a Fraction object by calling the int
 * greatestCommonDivider (int, int) method (based on divisions). Define a method for adding two Fraction objects, which
 * returns a Fraction object. Define a ExtendedFraction class derived from Fraction, which will have a constructor with
 * parameters (which calls the constructor from the base class) and which will redefine the method simplify() using an int
 * greatestCommonDivider (int, int) algorithm based on subtractions. Add a method for subtracting two fractions.
 * Instantiate two Fraction objects without parameters. Set the attributes of the data objects read from the keyboard.
 * Display the original attributes of the objects and the new defined attributes. Simplify, add and display results. Instantiate
 * two ExtendedFraction objects with data read from the keyboard. Simplify, add and subtract objects and display results.
 * Make an upcast from ExtendedFraction to Fraction and try to subtract the items. All operations will be called from the main() method.
