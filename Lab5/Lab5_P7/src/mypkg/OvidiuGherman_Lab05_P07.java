 *  Define a class called Vehicle which has as attributes the maximum number of passengers, its color and the maximum
 *  speed. Extend the Vehicle class within the MotorizedVehicle class which also includes the geo-location attributes (GPS
 *  coordonates â€“ create a class for this type of object GeoLoc) and the moving speed of the vehicle. MotorizedVehicle can
 *  move from point A to point B (the points are specified using a Point object which has two GeoLoc attributes) by using the
 *  move(Point B) method and which returns the total duration of the trip.
 *  Create a new class called Airplane which extends the MotorizedVehicle class and which add the attribute altitude to the
 *  move(Point B) method. This method will return the time needed to take the trip by taking into account that the plane
 *  will travel on arc of a circle specified through points A and B and the maximum altitude reached by the plane (the
 *  maximum altitude is reached half-way between A and B).
