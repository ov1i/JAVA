/* 3.
 *  Develop a class hierarchy of shapes and write a program that computes the amount of paint needed to paint different
 *  objects. The hierarchy will consist of a parent class Shape with three derived classes - Sphere, Rectangle, and Cylinder.
 *  For the purposes of this exercise, the only attribute a shape will have is a name and the method of interest will be one
 *  that computes the area of the shape (surface area in the case of three-dimensional shapes). Do the following.
 *  A. Write an abstract class Shape with the following members:
 *  	- an instance variable shapeName of String type
 *  	- an abstract method area()
 *  	- a toString() method that returns the name of the shape
 *  B. The file Sphere.java contains the Sphere class which is a descendant of Shape. A sphere has a radius as a private
 *  integer variable and implements the body of the inherited abstract method area().
 *  C. Define similar classes for a rectangle and a cylinder. The classes Rectangle and Cylinder are also derived from the
 *  Shape class. A rectangle is defined by its length and width. A cylinder is defined by a radius and height.
 *  Note: Each of the derived classes override the toString method and define specific mutator and accessor methods.
 *  D. The file Paint.java contains an interface that has a float constant paintPerSurfaceUnit.
 *  E. The file PaintThings.java implements the Paint interface and contains a program that computes the amount of paint
 *  needed to paint various shapes.
 *  Instantiate the three shape objects: deck <- Rectangle, bigBall <- Sphere and tank <- Cylinder. Make the appropriate
 *  method calls to assign each objectâ€™s specific attributes with data read from the keyboard.
 *  Compute the amount of paint needed for covering each created shape
