/* 6. Implement a Java application which draws a maze made up of squares. One of the squares (the entry points) is
 * colored in a distinct color. Use the cursor to guide the square to the exit. Any mistake resets the position of the square
 * and sets it back to its original position. Display a message when the square reached the exit point.
 * 			* Instead of the cursor, use the mouse's position to navigate through the maze.
 * 			** Touching the edges of the maze or exiting it, resets the game.
